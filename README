Taking inspiration from a traditional "Ideaboard", a corkboard or wall with lots of photos, images and sketches all pasted up on it to form a collective theme, we created an online ideaboard that pulls all of its "ideas" directly from Evernote notebooks and allows Onyx to share inspiration among its employees across the country.

Using the Evernote API we developed a project called The Evernote Ideaboard, that lets people visualize their notebooks in a unique way. One of the downsides of Evernote is that you are able to share a notebook with others, in order to effectively use it, you cannot use the client program and must use their web interface. The web interface of Evernote leaves a lot to be desired in terms of usability. In addition, both the client program and the Evernote website both lack the look and feel our team desired.
